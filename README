Usage:
    mlen FILE[s] or DIRECTORY


Description:
    mlen is a bash script that uses ffprobe to determined the total
    playtime of a given number of media files.


Requirements:
    You'll need ffprobe (ffmpeg), bc and printf.  You probably already have
    these.


Installation:
    You don't really need to install this (it's a shell script), but it makes
    things a little easier if you do.  To do so, as superuser and within the
    root directory to which you've extracted the archive, type 'make install'.


Uninstallation:
    Similar to the above, except you type 'make uninstall' instead.
